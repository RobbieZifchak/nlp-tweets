One of my fav phrases is a term a collab uses called “contribution anxiety.” The idea is people say empty shit bc they’re afraid if they don’t say *something* they aren’t contributing enough to a convo. But don’t let that anxiety stop you from doing the harder part-The listening.
"It’s usually “I’m surviving the best I can right now, but I’m okay.” Bc those ppl usually ask just to know if they need to place me in the “currently/possibly soon in the danger zone”, if that makes sense?. Every1 else gets, “Its not easy, esp with anxiety but I’m still here” 3/"

One thing I admit that was the cause of my low use of #Twitter the past couple of months aside from the pandemic causing me anxiety issues was my trying to make myself like #Facebook again when I don’t. I’ve come to accept that I will never enjoy being on Facebook.
I nearly had an anxiety attack during the show. Teens scare me already. But teen sociopaths? It was too much.
My irrational fear is that my nightmares will come true. I have very vivid emotional dreams and am always afraid of the truly awful ones following me into real life. And I'm sure the lack of good quality sleep makes the anxiety much worse... 😊
And maybe a director that understands the differences between social anxiety and autism.

I love waking up with anxiety
"Dear Lord, thank you for giving me a way out of anxiety and fear. Thank you for giving me power, love, and a sound mind. Please help me turn to you when I am troubled because you alone hold the answers I seek. In Jesus's name, amen."
"What does it mean to have a spirit of fear, and why is it so important that we fight it off? Think about something that you are afraid of. What causes you the most worry and anxiety? Now, think about who God is."
I've been off since last Wednesday & the mere thought of having to clock in tomorrow is giving me anxiety !!!

That is exactly what anxiety is. Anxiety is sometimes the triggering of an unresolved event in your childhood. Then there is the type caused by chemical imbalances in the brain which can be corrected with medication while the former needs extensive therapy to discover root causes
Trying to leave a Zoom meeting gives me THE MOST anxiety. Because in real life I’d just peace out without warning. ✌🏾🚶🏽

I have to agree with all of this and also many are clinically depressed and medicated for it in some form or fashion. Heck the Elder body I was on were all taking something anti-depressant or anti-anxiety related. And don’t forget the fibromyalgia and chemical sensitivity too.

"From stress bald spots, to anxiety attacks and full emotional breakdown episodes. I seeked help and got it and I am not that person anymore. Does my anxiety still get triggered? Yes it does. But now I know how to handle it and the people who love me knows how to handle it too."
"As I’m laying here at the same time I was born and reflect on the past year, I wanna say, I’m proud of the person I am today. Last year, I discovered about my Depression & Anxiety. I didn’t know how to control it and how to deal with it. I didn’t really love myself fully either."

Anxiety sucks
"Rebuild we must, and fortify our unity, from the mouth of the predator our necks we must reclaim, this rainbow of ours let us let it shine brighter than our anxieties, our fears, and our doubts, together we are the grand design, divided we become a sport, love is our essence."
"@AH_Michael I hope this isn’t too personal, can you tell me what the anxiety felt like? Like, what was the sensation?"
"Difference of opinion, fear, anxiety, and ultimately a lack of trust. Trust is earned after it’s been shattered the first time, so the outcome is guarding oneself from being hurt again. Imagine going through life guarded."
"Put simply - JKR prefers a marginalizing approach that would burden the very people the laws are intended, selfishly wishing to soothe her paranoid and seemingly unchecked anxiety. She doesn't provide sources, so we can't know if she's actually researched or gotten therapy. "

Also let’s not even start on my bad 2am anxiety driven thoughts. Also begone ex 😂 Let me gush in peace without worrying about you
Why this shit give me anxiety 
"Lisa I have had much success using those Thunder Shirts on various forms of dog anxieties... Remember The calmer you are when a dog is anxious the calmer they are. Our dogs feed off of our energy If we are worried they will have bad anxiety, they feel it and it makes it happen."
Alive! Sometimes barely cus anxiety is at an all time high lately but still alive. You?
"I had to focus and better myself, fightin anxiety smokin these trees"
i have such high anxiety right now and i cannot sleep/don’t want to
Having social anxiety can be stressful af
"okay my anxiety is definitely like 12 years old, calling me out on the shit I want no one to notice"
"I carry two cellphones, because one anxiety was not enough"
That is pretty cruel. To make fun of the anxiety of the poor dog who can't defend himself or herself💔
Yk what’s crazy Before quarantine I started ordering my own food with no more anxiety AFTER QUARANTINE IMA HAVE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO GET BACK TO THAT
realizing that if I want to get back on IUD birth control I’m gonna have to sit there alone (no guests and minimal staff. a nurse had to hold me the last time 🥺) with my airways covered (mask) this is a nightmare for someone with severe anxiety I would like to cry very much
"I've been struggling with suicide, depression, anxiety for years now and this fucking point I give up"

irl James had the power of God and anime on his side and tv James can't drink more than one cup of coffee a day without debilitating anxiety but he still uses terrible dad mugs with slogans like DEATH BEFORE DECAF because he's convinced normal adult = caffeine addiction

"As time went on, I kept receiving emails like this from #BetterHelp -- only on articles that dealt with anything that had to do with my personal journey on coping with #anxiety and #depression through my faith. Much of it was generalized, like exercise, meditation, therapy, etc."
That gives me so much anxiety. Good luck.
I sincerely pray the GOP does not fix the race. When you are in the WH the anxiety level in this nation will drop.🙏

Not sure... but not convinced they don’t really work at all. I think it’s the government’s way of giving a helpless public some form of action they can take because it does ease anxiety to think you can do something. I think it’s more psychological than anything.

7 years old when I started to have full blown anxiety attacks and I started to question my existence and what was causing these attacks. My dad’s solution was Pepto.

I deal with anxiety and have been seeing a doctor about it for about 10 years. Ignoring it almost put me in the hospital (very dramatically while at work) during a panic attack. Mental health is tied into physical well being.

People chose to @me. All I did was ask why. Nobody decreed anything I don’t understand the source of your anxiety over this
You can argue about the definition of “so many” I suppose. I still think the anxiety concerns are valid regardless of how anyone looks. Why you guys are invading my mentions over a picture I posted of something that was 100% firecrackers is something I still don’t get.

Gave up my anxiety meds years ago so now it's 10 a.m. scotch just to stop shaking so I can work. This is not ideal.

Realizing irritation can come from anxiety. Sometimes I find myself super irritable &amp; idk why.
I don’t know. Maybe? I think the underlying anxiety definitely changes wanting to eat and what we can stomach. PBJ for lunch or 1/2 donut with nespresso in the morning. “Cooking” a big meal seems beyond me. No desire. The kids eat kid-type foods anyway.

If you know me you know how close my family is. The strain this is causing on my family’s mental health is by far worse than any symptom you can get. Having to do this alone and seeing my moms frustration and anxiety with not being able to do anything takes a huge toll.

"Lots anxiety, definitely hard to sleep Stay healthy!"
My separation anxiety is going through the roof.
Just danced alone for the trees in Central Park and I feel so much better. The anxiety was a little high today and dancing releases all that tension. I recommend 10 minutes of dancing in your living room every day… https://www.instagram.com/p/B-YAr7WJWbv/?igshid=2vmwajsr4wqg

Sure is getting challenging to differentiate between regular life depression and anxiety from quarantine depression and anxiety
Maybe my anxiety lately has less to do with the current pandemic and more to me drinking 3 cups of coffee before 11am everyday

Quick question. Are there old news reports on how American’s coped with the anxiety post 9-11? See so many friends and family tweeting and posting about emotional breakdowns daily. I was 19 in 2001 (college freshman) I remember just having to block out the news after 2 weeks.

"Granted, my anxiety causes these in a weaker but chronic sense. I often have dyspnea anyway, but never enough to keep me from walking. The coughs are nervous coughs, so they're sparse and weak. But when I get anxious, they get worse. And worrying about covid makes me anxious."
"Something I worry most about: My anxiety's symptoms are similar to covid: dyspnea, nausea, (albeit, nervous) coughing. If I get covid, and if I'm unlucky with it, I may not know before it's too late. And even if I do suspect it, it's not like I can do anything; I live in NYC."

Know that you’re not alone. Feelings of anxiety and depression are very common during this global pandemic. Here are some reasons why your mental health is impacted. Together we can utilize indoor coping strategies and continue to strive for mental wellness. 
Is My Chest Tightness Anxiety or the Coronavirus?

"Why are there flyovers happening now in NYC? Here on the Upper West Side I keep hearing them. Not like regular LGA flight path kind. V post-9/11. Not super calming or reassuring. Plus: sirens (ambulances, fire engine, police) all day. Regularly. Very stressful + anxiety inducing."
"Totally. This is uncharted territory. I mean, I don’t mind the isolation at all. But when I let the outside world in the anxiety comes with it."
"“When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy.” Psalms 94:19 NIV"
"I feel this completely. And just human interaction of being in an office. As an extrovert with anxiety/depression I am aching to just be in the gym. Running outside is cute but when it’s cold and I trip over a child (and then catch them), it kills."
I'm trying hard to remember that holding feelings of anxiety in is often much worse than sharing them. I'm glad I have such a supportive community to share with. ❤️
going for a grocery run has some real “the last of us” anxiety.

Mental health tip for those with anxiety : hop in the shower before you do anything . Glass of water when you get out.
It’s creating a lot of unnecessary Anxiety
"There’s probably a lot of underlying anxiety, too. We don’t know the whole picture. But I do have a few very lucky friends in this position."
"It’s so easy to default to hopelessness. If you’re battling regular ol’ depression on top of the pandemic anxiety, you are seen and heard. The dread comes in waves but you’re not alone and we can only do what we’ve done before: take it day by day"
Anxiety and sleep paralysis. Life comes at you fast
"Same. I’m doing similar hours of researching force majeure clauses and executive orders, and figuring out places where our clients may be owed money due to a default. It’s hard to do when your anxiety is through the roof, I’ll tell you that. Hang in there!"
You and your mentally unstable husband got exposed. You caused someone to have anxiety and other mental health issues for four years. That’s evil. You have children. May karma spare them. 🐍

"The anxiety is extremely real. It might not be the path you expected or promised, but you’ll get through it. This is when your creativity will matter most! https://twitter.com/ninamehta/status/1242407962347548672?s=21"
"VERY MUCH THIS! If all the bills still accrue while we're shut down, I'll just owe X month of payments with ZERO back pay. This anxiety is why I'm awake at 3:19am trying to figure out how I'm going to pay for life depending Meds &amp; food in next few days. Eenie, meenie, minie, moe "

Infuriated that I don’t make sourdough loaves or successfully complete 1000 piece puzzles but instead dose myself each night to get on a baseline level of anxiety that’s manageable so I can turn off the news and put on king of the hill
Can I just get a fucking A in my classes. Bro my anxiety won’t let me care about fucking papers when people are deadass dying.

"New academic anxiety dream from 6 am this morning: I went to my class, about 1/2 the people were there -- I said, ""Shit! We were supposed to ZOOM!"" Anyone else ?"

"As against spreading the number of cases as they keep going up and feeding some people’s anxiety and hysteria, why don’t you spread some positivity and good will. You’re not the #Coronavirus indicator"

The bars at the airport are allowing customers to come in and order drinks “to go”. This is making a huge difference for me... I have flight anxiety and the odd conditions are spiking it. A few drinks are going to calm my nerves and provide me with a better flight experience 
I try to work 8 hours but I can’t focus..the news is making me an anxiety-ridden loon
"Ok I jinxed my anxiety bc it decided to tell me that my extra shortness of breath and chest pain was probably definitely pneumonia, lol (it wasn’t!! My lungs look good)"

Check on your friends with anxiety. We are NOT okay.

I have so much anxiety watching this
I haven’t had anxiety this bad in a while...
I think my anxiety of everything is getting to me because instead of just ignoring the men on Grindr that continue to message me to hookup I’ve now started to tell them that “You’re too fucking persistant please leave me alone”
"What a great time to be looking for an apartment! 😑 I found one but I’m still a fucking mess (stress, anxiety, etc.) Back to Indiana on Friday..."

Also anxiety can weaken your immune system!! 
Being trapped inside is anxiety inducing having grown up in abusive homes. Going outside was freedom. My heart goes out to all the kids who are stuck with someone they should trust but can’t.

"My therapist is doing online appts. I hope others will do the same, because, yes, it’s a very real concern. Anxiety levels for all of us are understandably ... high. And by high, I mean through the fricking roof."
"5. Take a deep breath, light a match, & burn that paper. 6. & whenever a old fear or anxiety comes up, remember the Ceremony you did, &amp; remember the issue is not yours anymore. P.S. Do this in a quiet place, take your time writing ✍️, play calm music, &amp; light a candle 🕯."
"1. Write out what you want to release to the universe. For example, situations you can’t control, people you can’t stop thinking about, fears/anxieties. 2. When you’re done writing out all that you want to release, give gratitude for where you’re at currently &amp; for your future."
Hanging on by a thread but a clean home makes me feel better/ offers clarity and it’s helps with my anxiety when I stay busy.

"Obviously there is tremendous anxiety associated with the pandemic and social distancing, let’s all take time to post pictures of our asses on IG. In some small way it helps us all have hope for a brighter day."
"Old trick I learned. If you’re feeling self centered fear or anxiety, reach out to someone and get out of your own head. It works. Trust me."
Really just want my anxiety to end.
"Washing hands #SocialDistancing stops the spread of #COVID19, but doesn’t help with reducing anxiety &amp; the need for direct human interactions. Find out what gives you comfort and do it. Pay attention to your mental health and that of those around you - #TogetherWeCan"
I saw a post on social recently about how people with actual diagnosed and/or profound anxiety deal with a mental apocalypse every day. 
"Best email I could’ve received. These are stressful times. My anxiety is going through the roof. I have not had to take meds to calm me down in YEARS and this pushed me right back to depending on them. All @CUNY professors should be understanding, school is not our top priority."
Sending hugs & hope any/all symptoms vanish. My anxieties are through the roof now &amp; wish I had some Xanax!! 🎈
Me: -cyclic states of anxiety -staring at my wall for hours at a time -considering watching paint dry for fun My Sims: -getting rewarded for throwing great parties -learning how to DJ -getting promoted and fulfilling life aspirations

Panic and anxiety attacks are demanding that I take a pause from the news today. I have push notifications on my phone in case something major happens. #breathe
"Anxiety is universal particularly when we have an inept Executive Branch and cruel Republican Party. We must all work toward finding a safe way to vote the bastards out. Keep positive, busy &amp; sane. "
The thought of taking hunter outside gives me crippling anxiety
When will things “normalize” so I can minimize the panic and reduce that stress around supplies and logistics? I want to have peace and quiet and boredom to rejuvenate and rest. Anxiety is negatively impacting sleep. Feel like boredom would help my sleep. Or sleep would be escape
My son had a fever last night and I was ready to off myself. This virus has my anxiety at an all time high and I think the worst of every situation!
"I don’t like running on treadmills, it gives me a lot of anxiety— even at mile high, which is a great class. But I might need to buy one for walking my 10,000 steps if we can’t go outside!"
My (undiagnosed) anxiety is through the roof rn. I feel off and I don’t like it. I wish my gov (local and state) can either agree to shelter in place or not. I need to be home for a little bit.

"Unfortunately, yes - people responded with inherent racism to Trump linking their economic anxiety with “others”. That’s not my point. COVID-19 played a role today too. But Bernie vs Biden is not an indicator of how Biden or Bernie would fare against Trump."
I get anxiety when other people talk about their anxiety
This gave me anxiety 
I'm binge eating again. I do this when ever I have high anxiety 😬

Haha. This season only added more anxiety to my anxiety.
Everyone’s stress and anxiety is showing in different ways. Cut each other some slack and spread love instead of passing judgment. This too shall pass ❤️
Been on an anxiety and social distancing fueled binge of self-love that has put my appendage in a paper mâché condition and will preclude any ass getting tapped at least until mid-Thursday.
My anxiety is just at an unworldly level and I need to stop watching the news but I want to be informed. There’s no winning here.

We understand. One thing that I am doing to ease anxiety is to check out beautiful meditation videos on YouTube. 💜
Oddly feel like the country is finally operating at my anxiety level. Any other anxious people feel the same?
Like my anxiety is kicking my ass the more I sit here and watch movies 
my head around things. Might lose my job and everything I’ve been working towards/enjoying for the last 7 years. My main depression/anxiety is coming from pretty much only that. My introvert-half is like “I CAME HERE TO WIN!!”
My anxiety went through the roof watching this. 
is my chest tight for the same reason it always gets that way which is because i have anxiety or is it because i have the plague

I just looked in the mirror and saw that my hairline is starting to randomly recede. Can you say stressed AND major anxiety. Maybe I’m just now noticing. Who knows! I’m gonna take a nap.
I literally just had to fight off an anxiety attack.... this shit is no joke

Mental Health Moments: Handling Anxiety During the Coronavirus Pandemic 
"We all want to stay home or work from home as we should, but let’s not forget a large group of people who uses going to work, their business, or anything else that’s cancelled to cope with their Mental Health. Whether it’s anxiety, depression, PTSD, this time of isolation........"
Why people imposing their anxiety on you? It is what is is. We staying home. Get you a bag of Doritos and watch a movie.
Arts orgs of all sizes are fragile even in the best of times. Let’s alleviate some of the anxiety that comes with isolationism by focusing on what we can do for others. It can be as easy as turning cancelled tickets into donations. 
My Moneybox is giving me anxiety ooo
"Smh ... my anxiety - calls back to back ... clients nervous about booking cancellation... smh I could cry, but I won’t - Cause I’m a G ( I’m really not guys )"

Another @ABC2020 viewer asks @drfader how to manage anxiety when places like the gym or local coffee spot are closed because of the #COVID19 outbreak. Here’s what he recommends:
"Trying to manage stress and anxiety, which is a beast that wants to be fed. Must deny deny deny. Not sure if reaching out to friends + fam supports that. Early days. Will see how it goes. Have a plan/tasks re: apt and feel like it’s the healthiest focus rn. Sleep would help, too."

This whole quarantine thing has shown just how little time I’ve had to be at home with little to nothing to do...in MONTHS. I can actually tackle big projects without the anxiety of other deadlines/tasks. Such as: organizing my fucking bedroom.
Learning that my social anxiety also includes a fear of never socially interacting ever again 😩
"Parents having a hard time socially distancing at home isn’t necessarily about them “not wanting to raise their own kids.” It’s about about them having to face new, pressing existential anxiety AND being completely out of normal routine in the most tedious possible way"

But real talk- if anyone’s depression/anxiety is on the fritz from self-isolation I’m happy to FaceTime anyone 🙂 we gotta stick together (but like apart) during these times.
I havent had such anxiety like this in like 3 years
"They want us to socially distance ourselves at a time where love is needed. We will have extreme high rates of depression, anxiety and suicide."
I have so much anxiety for being in the office today. I really don’t want to be here but we have no telework option because we are in peak operation. 
Sending love and light to everyone but esp those who still have to go to work today and face these scary times. Your anxiety and mixed feelings are valid. It’s not your fault and you’re not being selfish for having to go to work.
"diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety level been high for a few years now, the world is on the same level now and It looks like im sipping pina coladas by the beach compared to other ppl come on by and relax"
"Engineers we are calling for your expertise. Italy found a way without losing their marbles, we can certainly do the same thing here. Come on people, let's use our brains to conquer and not succumb to fear/anxiety. We can beat this if keep calm and level headed. "
Day one of #CoronaBreak and I’ve been up since 4:10. I’m sure it’s anxiety. Can’t wait for my teletherapy session today
Because that’s all everyone was talking about last night and I have crippling anxiety
"This joint is about child abuse , ptsd , depression , anxiety , poor choices , consequences, and reality. My Genesis. I just layed it and decided to drop it. No mix. No master. No edits. Just pain , truth , and life. Not for the faint of heart and all real https://audiomack.com/song/therealmpire/my-genesis"
Aight I’m 2 seconds away from an anxiety attack sos
"Eerie listening to a silent West End Avenue. Realized I haven’t seen cabs. It’s 9/11 quiet but with more furtive movements. Everything seems muffled muted. Ooh a car went by! Then periodic sirens come. I didn’t used to hear them, now they produce anxiety. We are only at the start"
Get yourself a friend who understands and shares your need for a late night anxiety phone session 
I’ve noticed that certain stress and anxiety symptoms I had regularly in my day-to-day life pre-self-quarantine are completely disappeared while others are new and disruptive. I’m glad I’m slowly figuring out methods of coping and motivation but the new stuff like not sleeping 💩
More people are going to die from #COVIDー19 related anxiety than the virus itself.
I'm paying too much attention to the news now and it's starting to cause me to live in a constant state of anxiety. There were precautions that were pushed to the side and now ppl we all know could suffer for it.
Well now I’m getting anxiety and feeling like I should hop on a plane tomorrow!
So as of right now knowing that I’m the front line for this virus and also having a 3 year old at home is just gets my anxiety going
Everything is so terrible I feel frozen with anxiety 😕😕😕😕😕😕
"I’ve been having so much anxiety lately, Social distancing is exactly what I need right now."
"I'm okay most of the time but find that for me, anxiety is like grief in that it hits HARD at funny times out of the blue. Love to you and C."
@TheJasonGenao portrayal of someone with PTSD and anxiety is one for the books! Acting at its finest #OnMyBlock
"I have to admit, feeling real panic and anxiety being in an apartment in NYC on an island with millions of people and no space to really have. Please send all the good vibes and tweets and animal pics etc."
"Started taking my temperature tonight, and I plan to do so daily as we move through this crisis, but I measured 99.7 just now and my anxiety just JUMPED THROUGH THE ROOF"
"Quarantine day 3: dealt with a huge migraine, watched the #DemDebate &amp; #WestWorld S3 premiere and did some more chores. I'm not going to lie; all of this has been anxiety-inducing and hard. But, I've realized through all of this just how connected all of us are at this moment."

My stepmom just called me and said my dad has a fever. No other symptoms. I feel the anxiety coming in hot. There’s nothing I can do. I just have to wait. This better not be what we think it is #coronavirus #COVID19
The way my anxiety is set up .... I can’t handle none of this
"This is the worst/best show ever. If you ever need something to calm your anxiety, this show works wonders for me. Because it’s SO damn ridiculous 😂🥴 "
"Yal. My anxiety is doing a number on me for obvious reasons. Check on the kid this week. Accepting calls, FaceTime calls &amp; ratchet memes. I need a distraction."

"All of these stories about people dying from COVID19 are giving me serious anxiety. I know people are posting because many are not taking it seriously, but it’s causing me some serious panic. So I’m going to get off Here for a bit. Stay safe, everyone."
I could take eight minutes of the debate before my heart started racing and anxiety started to build. 🤗 Back to blasting Carly Rae Jepsen.
High anxiety
I really need to go get a touch up on my roots but the way my anxiety is set up when I leave the house is making me wanting to just wear a hat for the next few months
Omg ur the second person who says that 😩😩😩😩😩😬 I haven’t watched it and i am already getting anxiety
quarantine is breeding grounds for my anxiety i feel #sad! :(
"About #Hoarding People are scared &amp; panicking, it is driven by anxiety....so please remember that if you are out &amp; plz try to calm people around you...I tell my patients ""Be the Calm, not the Storm. Breathe.We will get thru this""...I tell them repeat to themselves #coronavirus"
"I’m in the anxiety-ridden digestive issues stage, I think."
My anxiety is starting to bang on the door. But I’m trying to stay focused on the present. Feeling very great full for what I have and the people in my life. Tomorrow isn’t promised 🙏🏾
High anxiety 
"To those who work in venues, restaurants, bars, kitchen staff, porters, dog walkers, retail, airport/airline staff, bus drivers, transit operators, and anyone who works on the front lines who could feel the anxiety of contracting AND the anxiety of losing your job. I hear you."
"It’s funny...I’m finding that many people demanding others on social media to avoid going to bars/social scenes/gatherings, etc. are the SAME people to post photos of empty shelves/stores. JUST SO YOU KNOW....that incites high amounts of fear & anxiety in EVERYONE. Stop."
"It’s been a day of #anxiety and #depression, so @catturd2 spam will follow. It cheers me greatly. If it is too much, block me."
Anyone with ocd or anxiety like myself 😩this is a fucking nightmare now I’m thinking should have gotten two instead of one omg 😳

"I worry about mental health during this #COVID19 pandemic. Lots of loneliness, helplessness, and anxiety. From healthcare providers on the front lines to the children without school."
"A few days ago I accepted that I wasn’t going to get dissertation work done for a few days at least. Aside from everything—except NYC schools where my partner works—closing, the anxiety around everything was too much. I felt better once I let go of the cult of productivity."

Hot mess Sunday! Anxiety is kicking my behind today 
As @Atul_Gawande shared https://medium.com/p/social-distancing-this-is-not-a-snow-day-ac21d7fa78b4 #socialdistancing does NOT mean staying inside alone. And stress isn’t great for your immune system. Get some fresh air/sunshine. Avoid running groups but solo runs/walks &amp;just #play are probably good for your soul (and ⬇️ anxiety) – at Hudson River Park
Doing ok. Just avoiding the media. Don't need any anxiety on my hands

Mizuki is always ready for a closeup and always on #CBD because of her anxiety. #puppylove #chillax
When you have social phobia and OCD and anxiety and you are shy and you are an only child and you don’t drink so you don’t go to bars and you freelance and you can write and draw....... I should be having a meltdown over this situation but instead it’s like a balm lol yikea
"And those of us with no anxiety(sociopaths) or, minimal anxiety (heights and parachuting) are just in control, as a norm."
"I've had my good old left, under-breast tightness for days now too. Stupid anxiety. You have to do everything you can to try to relax 💙 I'm doing the same! Please stay safe and healthy 💙"
Feelin like this is a bad time to discover I probably need to medicate my anxiety lmao 
As much as I love our buses &trains - biking releases much needed endorphins to help offset the anxiety caused by the non stop scary news. 
The streets were dead quiet in Manhattan last night. I was walking my dog and a father was walking through a park holding his newborn baby - the dad was riddled with anxiety. Shit got to me.
"So with the very important and necessary social isolation occurring, I’m playing a lot more Pokemon sword/switch in general to keep my anxiety low while still being responsible to not endanger others. So if you want to trade or play some type of game or way together, HIT ME UP"
"My mom, a 53-year-old immunocompromised pediatric nurse, is traveling to Chicago today for work because she’s being forced to by her job and I am so scared for so many different reasons that my body can’t process all of this anxiety and I am ready to explode."
"My anti anxiety activity is making fancy pancakes like everything is fine. Grateful for a stocked pantry and a comfy home to ride this out, I know not everyone is as stupid lucky. Help your neighbors get through this however you can these coming weeks!! "
I feel so much more comfortable communicating with people through comedy it’s helped a little with my social anxiety
"Even though there was a ton of public anxiety. All the stores, restaurants, nightmarkets, schools, and Public spaces were still open. Mostly because of the seriousness of the situation and how everyone collectively followed these precautions."
knowing no matter what we as people face we are resilient strong beautiful made in gods image and we are all here for a reason so dont let fear or anxiety or regret eat you. And I hope the 3 years of toilet paper you bought serves you well. Love!

"Thanks. I lost control of my own anxiety for a few minutes today. I keep thinking this is the end of his simple, happy childhood."
Witness another symptom of late stage capitalism in collapse. And the do-si-do of rotating Democrat/Republican administrations doesn’t change a fundamentally unresponsive system. The anxiety that most people have already been living with is exacerbated by coronavirus.
I didn’t watch the news and limited my time on social media today and my anxiety levels about what’s going on have been significantly down. Control what you take in. Especially during times like this. We gon’ be alright! 💙

Scenes from a Generalized Anxiety Disorder... – at Dellapietras
Had to take a Xanax last night because my anxiety has been building around all these headlines. I get bad chest pains and usually go to the ER to be told I’m fine. Obvi can’t do that in these times. I forget my #anxiety becomes a physical thing if I ignore it mentally.
"Cleaning my apartment, giving my doggies extra long walks and getting outside because it helps my anxiety about all of this!"
Some of these require resources you may not have but what’s free is spreading positivity and laughter when you can. Check on friends and loved ones - we’re ALL feeling anxious but your moment of strength/happiness can help a friend who might be at a point of their worst anxiety

"If you are someone who is prone to anxiety, do yourself a favor and limit corona virus news. Don’t forget that the news is also a business. If it gets clicks, they will publish it. If it gets views, they will produce it. Sensation sells Inform yourself about practical measures"
(esp certain people who picked this month to start going to back to therapy for the first time in several years specifically to work on their anxiety) 
It’s hard to laugh when you have anxiety.
i’m trying not to let my anxiety run wild about everything that’s going but it seems like things just keep escalating every day 
I thought I had the corona virus today but it was just an anxiety attack
I'm feling a lot of anxiety. Its a scary time. That's why we all need to take care of ourselves and one another. And we must continue to do so even after this crisis is behind us.

So many people I wish I was cooler with I hate having crippling social anxiety
Nyu: Classes are now held online My therapist telling me how to cope with my stress and anxiety : 
The thing about these online classes is that my ADD brain hates things that aren’t heavily interactive. So this work is way more draining because it feels SO inactive and I’m worried I’m going to forget something because I’m out of routine so my anxiety is amped up to like ten.

I’m feeling a great deal of anxiety from my fellow Sanders supporters. This is a movement and it is not over! We cannot allow the Democrat party to dismiss us and have their way. We are still 99%. #NotMeUs is truly not about Bernie. We must continue to fight for our platform!
I’ve been doing social distancing my whole life. Only back then we called it crippling social anxiety

"i’ve dealt w anxiety ever since i was a child, it effect my education, my friendships, my own hobbies — i wish a walk could fix it. please do not spread this misinformation and blame those who are suffering. anxiety isn’t your fault."
"yes, walking can help reduce anxiety, however, for a lot of people anxiety isn’t an easy fix. it’s a long process. stop making people feel bad for being anxious. stop this stigma that there’s an easy fix. that it’s all in your head."
"Anxiety isn't something you can just will away or switch off like a light. You can't just ""walk it off"" or ""take a breather"" and suddenly it goes away. It takes time, getting help from a specialist, surrounding yourself in a good atmosphere and with good people."

i think a huge part of my anxiety and depression lately has been because of how toxic and suffocating my work environment is. it’s almost unbearable

What if anxiety came from your conditioning? Taming it is also part of the conditioning &amp; our common belief that anxiety is good for us. I’d like to challenge this multi-generational belief. What if we taught ourselves instead to come back to our natural peaceful connected state?

It’s funny to see the anxieties of boomers during the free love period verbalized in monologue and song and have that contrasted against the fairly libertine mores of 2020 New York. Curious if it’s functioning as the same kind of warning Mazursky’s film was.
I'm also glad you're less reactive. That's a great sign that the anxieties arent choking you 24/7.

"I wonder if there’s a correlation between the ill-advised nighttime Red Bull I guzzled and my current anxiety spiral. Nah, probably not."
2/... Bernie’s focus on class reductionism without sufficient racial analysis is why he constantly insists racists are just poor white people subjected to demagogues because of their economic anxiety....He says very little of their cultural anxieties that motivate that racism...
Something I actually said to ericka a few weeks ago “I always notice your social anxiety and it makes me feel bad for you”
He's making a racist economic anxiety argument. Sorry to see this race to defend one candidate.

@JoyceWhiteVance I feel a huge sense of anxiety today after the Orange Combover’s latest series of disasters. Is there an equivalent to the British system of a “Vote of Lack if Confidence”. that Americans can take as a way to get him &amp; his @GOP clowns out of office immediately?!

2019 taught me: Acceptance. Anxiety is real. Self-care. Respect/create boundaries. Explore brave spaces. Self-care. Trust your circle. Careers are fluid. SELF-CARE. 2020; please learn from my mistakes. And Basta Trump. #NewYear #SameMe
"Tbh, 2019 was the year I realized just how strong I was. I originally reflected on what I stepped away from, but I realized that reflecting on the things that I started because I let go of fears & anxieties that I felt were paralyzing is worth celebrating more. #cheers"

turns out the recipe for extreme anxiety is having to work and then being expected to celebrate a holiday later that same day. i’m having a terrible time 🙃
Stress is a part of life. Just like anxiety and depression. Stress is used to strengthen. It’s your ability to embrace it that may be the problem. Never allow stress to disturb your peace ❤️

FOR YEARS I was having extreme migraines so bad that I’d feel weak and overall sick. I kept telling doctors that something wasn’t right but would get brushed off due to my age (20’s) and was told I have anxiety. FINALLY a doctor listened to me and it turns out I had BRAIN TUMOR.
Would like to leave all this anxiety in 2019

Xanex def hits harder when you're actually having a substantial panic attack so if I'm having to take these to combat sleep anxiety I might as well be full on spiraling at 1:30am.
"Honestly, if y’all want anxiety so bad y’all can have mine lol because I do not want this shit at all."

I have major social anxiety I try to avoid conversation at my apartments monthly activities and parties for the neighbors but there’s always that one viejita who whats to start a conversation 🤦🏻‍♀️
"You don’t know anything about Driver or his anxieties and phobias. You probably don’t believe any actor who is similarly uncomfortable because you can only process via your own ego’s prerogatives. Stories like these are great for your resentments, your lack of empathy."
same but my anxiety would get the best of me ! 
Me drinking coffee = Anxiety. Why do I do this to myself. Sticking with tea from now on 🤦‍♀️

I've been slowly reprogramming myself to be more accepting of myself and the uncertainty in my life. I have a huge advantage in life and even if I fuck up it's not the end of the world. Not being perfect is perfectly normal. Anxiety is a mf #boycrazy #chrislife
"I don’t like making work mistakes, so I often function with anxiety and nerves regarding things that are often out of my control. Trying to push thru right now bc on the other side of tomorrow is my mother. 🥵"

The nice thing about anxiety is that I am never late for anything work related because planning my route there I’ll literally be like BUT WHAT IF ALL OF THE ROADS ARE ON FIRE AND IT TAKES AN HOUR LONGER THAN NORMAL
Anyone else get anxiety from ordering things online?
"I highly recommend Sam Sifton’s book “Thanksgiving: how to cook it well.” It’s a quick, funny, anxiety reliving read packed with great info and recipes. I’ve been hosting for 8 years and I re-read parts of it EVERY year. (No idea on stuffing. In my house, that’s @dwlaraway’s job)"
Waving to the train I should be on from the backseat of the Uber Pool I took because taking up space on the train at rush hour with my suitcase gives me anxiety 
Bout to stress telling people to delete my number it my phone because this built up anxiety is catching flame. If we don’t talk why do you need it. If you bring no value why do you need it. Imma start saying having my number is a privilege. You can get text free if ya need me

I know that feeling. I have almost the perfect amount to get to my next refill and just knowing I do not have a surplus gives me anxiety. Just visualizing your grandmother’s crystal bowl in your pinned tweet (the reason I started following) is what gives me calm.

Girl you mad late my mom spilled the tea to your mom about my anxiety and depression at an Ursula parent teacher conference 😑 
I’ve gotten really good at talking myself down from anxiety and I’m really proud of that
Absolutely don’t ignore the failures of today’s society - but telling someone they can’t feel depression/anxiety because there are people who have it worse than them really doesn’t help anything

I’ve dealt with anxiety and panic attacks since I was 11 years old and every time someone says the dramatic portrayal speaks to them or their experience as well I feel this huge surge of pride. It wasn’t until @lenadunham did it in Girls that I saw OCD portrayed like mine.
I’m back on two cups of coffee a day and I can’t tell if it’s because of my anxiety or if it’s what’s causing my anxiety 🤷🏼‍♀️

"@chrislhayes agree. But I feel something is not quite ‘right’ with @realDonaldTrump either. It’s not age..it’s anxiety, stress brought on by the fact that they KNOW they are going down on a subconscious level. There is a dissonance as they’re yet to catch up on a conscious level. "

You will never understand social anxiety unless you’ve dealt/deal with someone who has social anxiety. And even then you will never be able to fully comprehend it or how it makes a person feel.

People that get to live life without anxiety are so lucky
Maybe the likes and comments help with the anxiety .
My anxiety was already very high yesterday so this addition made falling asleep extremely difficult. I kid you not when I say I purposely opened my eyes many times to check she was not there. Nightmares.
"Ya play too much with this anxiety talk and the reason I don’t chime in is because it’s a very huge part of my life &amp; I’ll dead curse all y’all out . You can also be funny , outspoken &amp; ok in front of ppl &amp; STILL HAVE ANXIETY. This shit don’t have a “ look” . Grow up."

Bloomberg needs to pay for therapy for thousands of people. I can't even count the number of times my husband was stopped by NYC police for no reason. I blame Bloomberg for my anxiety. He knew stop &amp; frisk was racist &amp; most were innocent yet he persisted.

Protective glass of social media are for introverts. Social anxiety is not an umbrella for introverted. Social anxiety is a fear of being judged by masses. This includes media.

There's also response anxiety which can be remedied with dating templates that work really well if your trying to message 8-10 people. Always make your own.

Social anxiety is real. I fucks w you Summer Walker♥️🙌🏼
"Can’t defend Summer Walker anymore. When you host a meet and greet, and people pay money to see you, at your beckoning, it’s your job to be what they think you are on stage. Why have one in the first place if you’d anxiety is getting in the way. You’re wasting your fans time"
Damn anxiety has had me overthinking one slack message for a whole fucking week. Can we not please?

"Y’all mad at summer for being in tune with herself & that’s wack. She made it VERY clear that she’s introverted and has social anxiety before her tour, she’s said it so many times. So WHY ON GOD’S EARTH would you go to her tour or meet and greet and expect her to not act like-"

I think the part where she says who she is + her anxiety doesn’t fit with SHOWS &amp; TOURS... hell sis sing in a damn box for all I care.

we used to only play 4 songs... then started doing 5.. then on this last tour did 6 and I felt the anxiety kick in hard that we were playing for too long and taking up too much space and went back down to 5. does this happen to anyone else
I get really scared and self conscious when we play.. sometimes I feel like people don’t actually want to be there in the audience & can’t wait for our set to be over. this anxiety causes me to even cut our already short set shorter sometimes.

"periodT. Social anxiety deadasss be a cop out. And her fans understand so like ... allow that space to be one where y’all connect and be vulnerable. I just don’t get it, but again I’ve never listened to any of her records and nothing about her appeals to me rn lmaoo"
"Bad mood, tired confused for anxiety attack"
Social anxiety gives ppl the impression they are uninterested in the present moment. I also think they are pushing her to make fast money &amp; should show down the whole pace of her career
Her social anxiety is becoming a distraction and in return cheat her fans out of moments. Take her off the tour her loan ain't going no where. Focus on those streams and merch
"I just started experimenting with CBD for anxiety relief due to chronic IBS. Dr seemed to help with the IbS and I find the CBD extremely successful, more than Xanax, at calming my head and helping me feel normal again. I may have to look up Hemp 🦈"

Y’all are making all these excuses for entertainers with anxiety issues but no one has forced them to choose that profession. They can literally do something else that does not have to involve dealing with the public

Y’all not real fans of Summer Walker. I’m convinced. Why would you buy and greet tickets to meet somebody that publicly made it known that she suffers from social anxiety... then be mad when you disappointed in the experience?? Y’all might be slow.
